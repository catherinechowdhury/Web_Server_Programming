# Web Server Programming

Hello, all! My name is Catherine Chowdhury. I am a graduate student at SUNY New Paltz. I started this journey four years ago, when I attended Rockland Community College. I have greatly enjoyed learning how to program. My favorite courses have dealth with CyberSecurity. This is the field I am hoping to pursue. My favorite project was implementing the Blowfish Algorithm and creating a program to encrypt passwords, similar to how you would store passwords in Google Password Manager. 

This project will be different than other projects I have worked on in the past. In this project, the goal is to get a fitness tracker app up and running! What I would like to add, in addition to keeping track of your fitness journey, is a mood tracker. There is a strong correlation between exercise and your mood state. I have a mood tracker separate than my fitness tracker on my phone. By combining both, it will be easier to keep track and give me a better understanding on my mental state and let that be a motivator to continue exercising. 

I'm excited to start working on this! Let's see where the journey takes us!
